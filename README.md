### What I learned

I was taking a front-end development course when I faced this challenge, and everything felt overwhelming at first. I looked at the design and wondered, "How is this done?" I had this question in my mind but no idea how to solve it. There was a voice inside me that constantly asked, "How do I do this? How do I do that?"

As I continued with my course and learned the basic concepts of HTML and CSS, I began to connect the dots and discover the magic behind web design! I thought to myself,   
"OhðŸ’¡, so this is how they create a layout for responsive design"    
"OhðŸ’¡, so this is how I can easily center boxes along the vertical axis."   
It felt amazing and now I am much more confident to continue this road. 

### Extra useful resources:

- [The viewport meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design#the_viewport_meta_tag): Small trick, at first I wasn't aware of this, hence I was confused a lot
- [BEM css naming convention](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/): Makes it easier for both code writer and reader
- [css custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties): Pays a huge rule in big and complex designs
- [box-sizing property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing): This one is tricky too if you don't take it in considration when aiming for pixel perfect design
